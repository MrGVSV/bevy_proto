# Each template is a relative path from this prototype file, pointing to another prototype to inherit.
# Luckily, you don't have to write out the full filenameâ€” the extension will be automatically added
# based on this file's extension. So the templates below are actually expanded as:
# [ "./Healthy.prototype.yaml", "./NPC.prototype.yaml" ]
# Templates are applied in reverse order. So templates listed first override templates listed last.
templates:
  - Healthy
  - NPC
# Templates can also be listed inline:
#   templates: [ Healthy, NPC ]
# Or without brackets (deserialized as a comma-separated string):
#   templates: Healthy, NPC
